# Bible Study App

A modern, fast, and responsive Bible study application built with Rust and Leptos. Features fuzzy search, chapter navigation, and a clean, distraction-free interface for studying scripture.

## Development

### Prerequisites

This project uses [Nix](https://nixos.org/) for reproducible development environments. You'll need to:

1. [Install Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html)
2. [Enable Nix Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes) (add `experimental-features = nix-command flakes` to your Nix configuration)

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server with hot reload:

```bash
nix run .#dev
```

This will:
- Generate Tailwind CSS assets
- Start the Tailwind CSS watcher for style changes
- Launch the Trunk development server
- Open your browser automatically at `http://localhost:8080`

The server will automatically reload when you make changes to Rust code or styles.

### Building for Production

Build the optimized static site:

```bash
nix build
```

The built assets will be available in `./result/` and can be served by any static web server.

### Development Shell

Enter a development shell with all tools available:

```bash
nix develop
```

This gives you access to:
- Rust toolchain with WASM target
- Trunk (WASM web application bundler)
- Tailwind CSS
- All project dependencies
